# QGIS Training Materials

It is important to orient people into how the training works since most people are used to 'following the notes’. It also takes a little time to get used to the training modality but once they do I think they get much more in-depth knowledge.

Our plan is to build out a curriculum of vertical topics (e.g. symbology), horizontal topics (how do I combine skills from various vertical topics in a workflow), DRR specific training (generally theory of preparing for disasters) and InaSAFE (as a vertical topic).

We also want to introduce the serious concept game into the curriculum.

In June 2017 we started adding OSM to the mix.

We have also provided a script which converts all odt worksheets to pdf. The script is convert_odt.sh which should be run before begining the training manual.
